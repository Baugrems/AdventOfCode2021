# AdventOfCode2021

Each Day is saved as its own folder. Might become a mix of languages but I'm starting in Python. Hopefully I have time to finish this year...

- Day 1: Python for both parts. Finished on Day 1 (December 1st).
- Day 2: Python for both parts. Finished on Day 2 (December 2nd).
- Day 3: Python for both parts. Finished on Day 3 (December 3rd). - This one was kind of ugly... sorry to anyone reading through it. I should have separated a few things out info functions but did not...
- Day 4: Python for both parts. Finish on Day 4 (December 4th) - Starting to get heavier. Might leave Python soon. Made an object for each bingo board and each square. Gave them status variables and stored a matrix of squares on each board. For part 2 I just copied part 1 but instead of returning a winning board first, I remove boards form the array until only one was left
- Day 5: Python for both parts. Finished on Day 5 (December 5th) - This one wasn't so bad. Stuck to python and got it done. Made a steam vent object and use used an array of ints to store overlap
- Day 6: Python for both parts (in one file). Finished on Day 6 (December 6th) - Extremely easy if you don't hit the pitfall of storing numbers individually. Use a map/dictionary!
Day 7 - Python for both parts. Finished on Day 7 (December 7th) - I forgot to even write this down at first. It was so easy and fast.
Day 8 - Python for both parts. Finished on Day 8 (December 8th) - This one was fun. Mapping the segments was done REAL ugly though. Like, real ugly.
