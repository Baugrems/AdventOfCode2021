# AdventOfCode2021

Each Day is saved as its own folder. Might become a mix of languages but I'm starting in Python. Hopefully I have time to finish this year...

- Day 1: Python for both parts. Finished on Day 1 (December 1st).
- Day 2: Python for both parts. Finished on Day 2 (December 2nd).
- Day 3: Python for both parts. Finished on Day 3 (December 3rd). - This one was kind of ugly... sorry to anyone reading through it. I should have separated a few things out info functions but did not...
- Day 4: Coming in 21 hours.
